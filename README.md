# Get-TenantAdmins
This PowerShell script connects to Microsoft Graph and exports a list of users assigned to directory roles (admin roles) in your tenant. The output includes each user's **Role Name**, **Display Name**, **User Principal Name (UPN)**, and **User ID**, and is saved to a CSV file for auditing or reporting purposes.

You will be prompted to sign in and consent to these scopes when running the script.

# Output
